\section{Target User}
\label{section:target-user}

The target user in a software project refers to the specific
group or demographic of individuals for whom the software is designed and
developed. Identifying the target user is a crucial step in the software
development process as it helps the development team tailor the software to
meet the needs, preferences, and requirements of that particular user group.
Understanding the characteristics, behaviors, and expectations of the target
users is essential for creating a user-friendly and effective software solution.

Here are some key aspects related to defining the target user in a software project:

Demographics: This includes factors such as age, gender,
occupation, education level, and other demographic characteristics. Different
age groups or professional backgrounds may have distinct preferences and
requirements when it comes to software usability.

Skill Level: Consideration of the users' technical proficiency and
familiarity with similar software or technology. The level of technical expertise
can influence the complexity of the user interface, the need for tutorials or
documentation, and other user support features.

Industry or Domain: For software solutions designed for specific
industries or domains, understanding the unique challenges, workflows, and
terminology within that industry is crucial. Tailoring the software to meet
industry-specific needs is often necessary.
